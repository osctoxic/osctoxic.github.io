# what is this?
it's a website that basically allows anybody to view the discord api status

it currently features
- the status of all apis (lol)
- a short description of what the website is for
- a hyperlink that directs you to the official discord status website

think of this website, as a summarized verison of the status page

# what is the website domain?
https://osctoxic.github.io/

i will only be using github.io for the domain, because i'm broke (af)

# im so bad at this hosting website shit so here's a disclaimer!!
the website may go down because of the bunch of errors, the system is cancelling some random shit i don't even know about
so yeah, i'm active on twitter, so let me know if it goes offline, and i'll provide a update @osctoxic
